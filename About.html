           <p class="firstpara">+852 city is a guide for people who have just arrived in Hong Kong and would live in the city for a while. 
        </p>
        <p>They can use the website to quickly and effectively learn pop culture in HK as it is not taught in any schools or anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>The aim of +852 city is to help the “outsiders” feel more” insider” and that way we can all feel equal and not have conflict with each other.
        </p>
        <p>This website is for them to utilise the knowledge they gained and use it for their daily lives.
